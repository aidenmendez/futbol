### Template for DTR Memo

Project: Futbol

Group Member Names: Aiden Mendez, Saundra Catalina, Joe Jiang, Samuel Yeo

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
  - Don't merge first pull request ever.
  - Better understanding of reading in data from other files(not from .rb)
  - Smooth workflow

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
  - Joe: Detail-oriented, break large problems into smaller components, analytical
  - Samuel: Error messages
  - Saundra: Organizing classes and structure by utilizing logic. Integration
  - Aiden: Bigger picture concepts, visualizing how the larger components work together(integration)

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
  - We have good individual strengths that can be paired with each other in order to break down a larger concept into smaller components and be able to bring it back to a bigger picture.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
  - 5:30ish (subject to change)
  - Depends on pairs
  - Election Day: School Hours, me and Joe should try to vote early.
  - Weekends: On pair level: Sundays are a nope.
  - Start Iteration 2 by Saturday Oct 24
  - Group retro by Mon Oct 26
  - Group retro + Start Iteration 3 by Thursday Oct 29

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):
  - As a whole group: Retro at least twice a week, every 3 days
  - How long something should stay in "Needs Review" column: Same Night(try to get all reviewed every night)
    + Try to divvy up reviews fairly in terms of quantity
  - Decisions can be expected to be reviewed as a whole if the concept is a larger part of the iteration/group.
    + Smaller concepts should be reviewed by other pair.
  - Emotional and mental well-being with pair/partner.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
  - Mocks & Stubs
  - Abstract everything out as much as possible (specialize methods/helper methods)
  - Aiden: Abstracting everything(knowing when to stop/when to keep abstracting)
  - Sam: Git
  - Joe: TDD
  - Saundra: Knowing when to create separate classes.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
  - Split up Iteration 2 by Category of Methods
  - Dummy CSV initially, Mock Stubs later (implement by iteration 2)
  - Separate Iteration 3 by Classes we're separating Iteration 2 by

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
  - Review pull requests before merging
  - Have partner aware of branches being created
  - Github Project
  - Linting
  - Spec Harness
  - Ruby Style Guide

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
  - 25/5, 60/10

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
  - Trying before giving feedback (Even with that gut feeling of it not working)
  - Specificity, Actionable, Kind
  - Write specific comments in the code during PR's

Additional Remote Considerations:
  - Keep in mind the Pomodoro Breaks PLEASE

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
  - Github Project

Day 1 Agenda:
  - Read through all iterations
  - Reconvene @ 7:00PM MST to conceptualize Iteration 1
